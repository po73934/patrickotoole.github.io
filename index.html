	<p> I was born in Fredericksburg Virginia in the great year of 1998. As a young boy I enjoyed what felt like long walks on the beach with my family and reaking havoc around the house. When I was 8 my family moved down to Georgia because my dad had gotten an administration job in the Department of Defense education administration. We moved to a small town called Peachtree City, Georgia. I attended school there from third grade until half way through my junior year of high school. One October evening in 2014 my dad came home from work and said four words I'll never forget "We're moving to England." At this point in my life I had never been to Europe or out of the continental United States. Immediately we started packing the house because my father report date was Jan 15. It was a quick three month span of packing, preparing, and researching for your new home.
